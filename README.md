A Pastebin project that allows users to store and share text in a simple format along with short links. This project was initially named "safebin" because it implemented end-to-end encryption. However, it was later rewritten, removing the end-to-end encryption mechanism and using simple storage to simplify sharing and direct access from the raw path.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```
